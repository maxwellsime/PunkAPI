# Punk API

Kotlin Project exposing the now defunct [Brewdog Punk API](https://punkapi.com/) into HTTP endpoints using Ktor. Inputs and outputs in JSON format.

Uses: Gradle, Kotlin, Koin for dependency injecting, Ktor server/client framework, Kotest and mockk for testing.

## Reasoning
I originally continued with this application to cement the knowledge I gained from working in a professional environment, as much fun as I had coding this small project the API has now become defunct thus this little application is dead :(
